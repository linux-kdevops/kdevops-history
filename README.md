we've split the git trees up and moved results out. The [new kdevops git tree has been modified to exclude results and is here!](https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops).
This git tree serves for historical purposes only now.

The results have been placed into another [kdevops results archive](https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops-results-archive).

This git tree serves only as history reference.
