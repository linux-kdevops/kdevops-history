This project is provided provided under :

	SPDX-License-Identifier: copyleft-next-0.3.1
	LICENSES/preferred/copyleft-next-0.3.1

In addition, other licenses may also apply. We embrace the same SPDX
practice as used in the Linux kernel, for those details refer to under
Linux:

	Documentation/process/license-rules.rst

for more details.

Note: Linux accepts copyleft-next licensed code, however, even though
copyleft-next is GPL v2 compatible we use a dual license tag on Linux
to err on the side of caution. And so, if you ever do wish to use code from
this project on Linux be sure to use this tag instead:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later OR copyleft-next-0.3.1

This project equally accepts GPL-2.0 code only as copyleft-next is GPL v2
compatible.
