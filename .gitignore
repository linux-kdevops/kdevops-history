# For now we ignore all results as we have work to do:
# - copy only data for failed tests
# - envision a way so that regressions are clearly visible with a git diff
#   against this tree
# - we have failures upstream for the current tests, these are not bugs
#   upstream but instead bugs in the tests which we need to fix.
# - we have to be happy with a format of known failures we are happy with
#   carrying in this repo just as we have with fstests. We are not there
#   yet.
