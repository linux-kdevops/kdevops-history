# This list is used by git-shortlog to fix a few botched name translations
# in the git archive, either because the author's full name was messed up
# and/or not always written the same way, making contributions from the
# same person appearing not to be so or badly displayed. Also allows for
# old email addresses to map to new email addresses.
#
# For format details, see "MAPPING AUTHORS" in "man git-shortlog".
#
# Please keep this list dictionary sorted.
