	  When you run kdevops for the first time we can enable options
	  to help you install software you may need, as well as do sanity
	  checks for you. Enabling this option will set to the default to "y"
	  for a series of entries which will help you with this first run.
	  Enabling these are not required, they do however help.

config GIT_ALTERNATIVES
	bool "Use git trees from sources which we know only work"
	default y
	help
	  A few supported workflows require additional software to be installed.
	  An example is the fstests git tree when testing with fstests. Another
	  is the nbd (network block device) git tree which is required when
	  using blktests to allow you to compile and install the nbd server and
	  client on some distributions where these binaries not available for
	  the distribution.

	  Ideally you want to be using the latest and greatest from the
	  respective upstream project's git trees. However, sometimes using
	  the respective upstream project's git trees means you have to deal
	  with build issues. This is specially true for projects which don't
	  really have stable releases like fstests. Running into these issues
	  as developers is acceptable, we just try to fix those issues and
	  move on with life. However, if you are working to do automation of
	  testing then running into any new silly compile issues is a huge
	  detriment to your efforts.

	  To help with this, the kdevops project also has forked a few of the
	  needed repositories and keeps its own respective tree master branches
	  in a working state, so to ensure that users won't run into oddball
	  build issues. These git trees would not exist unless an issue is
	  known to exist with an existing upstream project, and so these trees
	  may also contain a small delta of fixes to address these changes.
	  The kdevops project commits to ensuring that all delta carried in
	  these trees are already submitted to their respective upstream project.

	  The kdevops project relies on two mirrors for its alternative git
	  trees:

	    * github
	    * gitlab

	  We default to using kdevop's github mirror.

	  The list of projects which kdevops currently forks is maintained
	  below:

	   * fstests

	  If you don't see a git tree above, it means that this option
	  (GIT_ALTERNATIVES) will not affect how we use that tree.

	  If you are a kernel developer and don't mind running into the
	  all the bumps in the road with using all upstream projects then you
	  should just disable this. You can always disable this without
	  running 'make menuconfig' by just using the latest kernel-hacking
	  defconfig:

	    make defconfig-kernel-hacking

	  Likewise to ensure you always use the conservative options you can
	  use the kernel-testing defconfig:

	    make defconfig-kernel-testing

	default n if !HAVE_KDEVOPS_CUSTOM_DEFAULTS
	default KDEVOPS_DEFAULT_SETUP_POSTFIX_RELAY if HAVE_KDEVOPS_CUSTOM_DEFAULTS
	help
	  The most secure and easiest way to send email reports is to
	  configure a relayhost on on your postfix configuration. A relayhost
	  is set up by just modifying /etc/postfix/main.cf with the variable:

	  relayhost = foo.host.com

	  And then we'd restart postfix. Say y here only if its your first
	  time configuring your hypervisor. This is not needed after the first
	  setup.

config HYPERVISOR_TUNING
	bool "Enable kernel hypervisor tunings"
	default y if VAGRANT
	help
	  If you are going to be using a kernel-ci setup with virtualization
	  it means you will end up with many guests using the same software
	  and running the same binaries. And so a few kernel tuning options
	  can be enabled to help save memory pressure on your host.

	  Enabling this will enable you to select which recommended kernel
	  tunings to enable on your host if it is running Linux. To be clear,
	  these tunings are set on the localhost where kdevops is cloned.

if HYPERVISOR_TUNING

config HYPERVISOR_TUNING_KSM
	bool "Enable Kernel same page merging on the host"
	default y if VAGRANT
	help
	  Enabling KSM can save tons of memory, in some kernel-ci systems with
	  about 60 guests it has saved about 135 GiB of RAM. If you enable this
	  option what we will do is run the following on your host:

	  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run

	  For more information about KSM read:

	  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html

config HYPERVISOR_TUNING_ZSWAP
	bool "Enable zswap on the host"
	default y if VAGRANT
	help
	  Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages
	  Although in theory designed for swap, you can enable zswap and still
	  never touch disk, and only use the benefit of zswap for compressing
	  certain amount of memory. This holds true so long as zswap doesn’t
	  actually evict pages from memory to disk. We can verify this as
	  follows on a Linux host:

	  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages
	  0

	  In this case, 0 indicates that there is nothing from zswap touching
	  disk. If you enable this option what we will run is the following on
	  your host:

	  # echo 1 > /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled

	  For more information about zswap refer to:

	  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/vm/zswap.html

config HYPERVISOR_TUNING_ZSWAP_MAX_POOL_PERCENT
	int "Zswap max pool percentage"
	default 90
	depends on HYPERVISOR_TUNING_ZSWAP
	help
	  Zswap's default max pool percentage is set to 20%. This means zswap
	  will use up to 20% of compressed pool in-memory total, and once the
	  amount of compressed pool in-memory used by zswap passes this
	  threhold it will start evicting to memory disk. We want to avoid
	  evicting to disk as much as possible, and so we highly recommend
	  increasing this to 90%.

	  With the defaults you would see:

	  # cat /sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent
	  # 20

	  Enabling zswap tunning, we'll modify this as follows for you:

	  # echo 90 > /sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent
