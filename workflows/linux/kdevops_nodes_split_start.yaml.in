# Note: vagrant is not a fan of hosts with underscores.
#
# Modify the hostname to include a purpose, and then extract it later with
# ansible, for instance with:
#
# section: "{{ ansible_hostname | regex_replace('kdevops-') | regex_replace('-dev') | regex_replace('-', '_') }}"
#
# So if you say embraced kdevops-pokeyman and kdevops-pokeyman-dev you'd end up
# getting in the section always as pokeyman. As is below, with the above
# ansible regex you'd get the digits.
