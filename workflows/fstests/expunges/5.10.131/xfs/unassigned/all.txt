xfs/291 # failure on debian/buster in both xfs_reflink and xfs_reflink_1024 configs. xfs_repair (v4.20) fatal error -- unable to add AG 2 reverse-mapping data to btree. This test may need fixes similar to generic/204 to deal with reflink disk space calculation (see commits 1e24e517,a8f5f152e). It is one of the few tests that still runs xfs_check and it failed with "xfs_check failed" error. xfs_check is not considered reliable and xfs maintainer does not run it.
