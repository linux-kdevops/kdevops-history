	  By default we aim to spawn enough hosts to cover testing the full
	  range of supported features upstream on the Linux kernel for xfs,
	  and for you to also be able to do development on each section
	  concurrently. This consists of a total of 16 hosts created, disabling
	  this option let's you manually select only the sections you
	  want to test. This is useful if for example you have reduced system
	  resources or your target kernel does not enable certain features
	  which you don't care to test for.

	  Since fstests tests are not parallized and cannot easily be parallized
	  and since there are many different ways in which you can create an
	  xfs filesystem we have devised a strategy to split up tests by the
	  type of xfs configuration used when you created the filesystem. The
	  fstests suite allows you to specify different configurations using
	  "sections" on an fstests configuration file. We create then one host
	  per supported target section for each respective architecture.

	  Today this consists of 8 different sections for x86_64, and 9 for
	  ppc64le and aarc64.

	  Each section uses different mkfs.xfs commands which enable different
	  features. By default we also rely on two spawned hosts per tested
	  section, one used to establish a baseline and another for
	  development purposes, if KDEVOPS_BASELINE_AND_DEV is enabled.
	  Since a total of 8 xfs sections are currently supported on x86_64,
	  this means by default 16 hosts will be spawned to test xfs with
	  x86_64 unless KDEVOPS_BASELINE_AND_DEV is used. Likewise for
	  ppc64le and aarch64 this consists of 9 target xfs sections for
	  a total of 18 hosts spawned if KDEVOPS_BASELINE_AND_DEV is
	  enabled.

	  You can enable this to allow you to override the spawned hosts, to
	  reduce the number of sections tested and spawned hosts.
