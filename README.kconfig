This effort allows for independent projects to use the Linux kernel's
kconfig on external projects, and make updates of config really easy
to do. It does this by letting you use this tree as a git subtree.

For more details and to keep this small please refer to a simple demo
project which demonstrates how to use this and uses it itself:
